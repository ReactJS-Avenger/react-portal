### React Portal

Problem: When we want to render the component which may be completely seperate from the original component, such as tooltip, modal etc....It break the UI or parent div.


Solution: Portals Provides a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component still it can use all the functionalities of main DOM.
